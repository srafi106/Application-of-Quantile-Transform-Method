## 📘 Overview

The Quantile Transform Method (QTM) provides a general and flexible way to simulate random variables from distributions whose cumulative distribution function (CDF) does not have a closed-form inverse.  
This repository includes:

- R implementations of the Quantile Transform Method  
- Simulation examples for several continuous distributions  
- Code used to generate figures and tables in the paper  
- Numerical techniques for approximating inverse CDF values
